The MetallicA OLD truetype font!!!
Version 1.1gg

I was in the #metallica IRC channel a few days ago and someone
joined the channel.  His wish was for someone to give him, or
tell him where to get, a METALLICA "font" for his usage.

I told him that I did not know of any because I have been looking
for quite a while also.  All of the other persons in the channel
also did not know of any font available.

I was searching around my computer and I found a font-creating
program.  Then I thought, I know, I'll make a METALLICA font!!

Well, there will be two fonts to make:

The "NEW" version, and the "OLD" version.  The new one being on "LOAD"
and the "OLD" being on the albums previous to Load.

Thank you and enjoy your font!!!



I would like to hear your comments/suggestion!
